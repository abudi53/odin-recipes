    <h2>Description:</h2>
    
    <p>If you’d told me 10 years ago that I’d be writing a blog post about Kibbeh Nayyeh I would have laughed; I didn’t
        like this dish in the past simply because it has raw meat, and despite the fact that it’s very famous in
        Lebanon. And I assume that it’s natural for anyone who isn’t familiar with this dish to wonder a bit about the
        consumption of raw meat… but I’d say you gotta give it a chance.</p>
    <p>in this post, we’re featuring mom’s tested and proven Kibbeh Nayyeh recipe. How proven? We’ll, she’s made it for
        the past 5 decades. virtually every Sunday for our family lunch as a side dish.</p>

    <h2>Recipe:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Since we're going to be eating it raw, freeze the meat for 2 weeks prior to making the dish if possible in
            order to reduce typical raw meat contamination and bacteria. Also try to buy quality local, fresh meat
            whenever possible.</li>
        <li>Partially thaw the meat for 6 hours in the fridge prior to preparing the dish.</li>
        <li>Place the Bulgur in a small bowl and rinse it with cold water, then drain and squeeze to get rid of as much
            water as possible.</li>
        <li>Put the meat in a food processor along with about 5 cubes of ice and half of the cinnamon and spin it for
            about 3-5 minutes until it becomes very fine. Important: stop the processor every minute or so and feel the
            meat to ensure it’s not warming up. If it is, add a bit more ice cubes and spin. Once done, set aside in a
            large bowl.</li>
        <li>To make the spice mix, put the green pepper, mint, marjoram, onion, salt, chili powder and 7-spices in the
            food processor and mix them well.</li>
        <li>Add the Bulgur, spice mix on top of the meat and knead well for a few minutes to make sure that all
            ingredients have integrated well. </li>
        <li>Immediately after the kneading, place the Kibbeh Nayyeh in a serving plate and flatten it making symmetric
            dents in it with the edge of a spoon for show.</li>
        <li>Drizzle extra virgin olive oil and fresh mint leaves on top.</li>
        <li>Serve cold along a side of pita bread, and a veggie plate which may include white onions, green onions,
            chili peppers, mint, salty chili pepper pickles etc...</li>
    </ol>
