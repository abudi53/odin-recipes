    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Kafta is a Lebanese kebab or meatball made up of only four ingredients. It is very popular with slight variations, throughout all of the Middle East. In Lebanon, we know it as kafta, but in other parts of the Middle-East, it is more known as kofta. This Lebanese version is made up of ground beef, finely chopped parsley, chopped onions and a spice blend (7 spices, salt and pepper.)</p>
